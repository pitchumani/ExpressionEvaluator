# Problem: Expression Evaluator Framework

**Goal: Design a C++ framework to parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions like:**
```
(3 + 4) * (2 - 1) / 5 + sqrt(16)
```

**Requirements**
* Support binary operators: +, -, *, /
* Support unary functions like sqrt, abs, sin, cos
* Use a factory to instantiate different expression node types
* Design abstract classes/interfaces for expression nodes
* Make the evaluator extensible to add new operations easily
